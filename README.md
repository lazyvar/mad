# The Mad Programming Language

## Overview

## Definitions
To define something, use the ```:``` operator.
```
greeting: "Howdy"
score: 100
contains: true ! this is a comment, everything after "!" is ignored

```
By default, all definitions are immutable.
```
greeting: "Hi" ! Error: greeting already defined
```
To make definitions mutable, use the ```var``` keyword
```
coins: var 33
coins: 7 ! coins = 40
```
